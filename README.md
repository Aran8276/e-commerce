## Backend Note
This project also relies on a backend stack using Supabase. Please be aware that the server might be down most of the time, as it needs to be renewed every week due to inactivity. This only affects the “Shop” web route (see the 5th preview for an example of a fully working one). The primary focus of this project is on the front-end rather than fullstack/backend development.
